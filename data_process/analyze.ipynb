       "  'output': \"So I've got this problem here about an arithmetic sequence. The terms given are: -1/3, y + 2, 4y, and it says it continues from there. I need to solve for y. Alright, first things first, I need to remember what an arithmetic sequence is. An arithmetic sequence is a list of numbers where each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference to the preceding term. That constant difference is called the common difference, often denoted by 'd'.\\n\\nSo, in this sequence, the first term is -1/3, the second term is y + 2, and the third term is 4y. Since it's arithmetic, the difference between the second and the first term should be equal to the difference between the third and the second term. That is, the common difference 'd' is the same between consecutive terms.\\n\\nMathematically, that means:\\n\\n(y + 2) - (-1/3) = 4y - (y + 2)\\n\\nI need to solve this equation for y. Let's write it out step by step.\\n\\nFirst, simplify the left side:\\n\\n(y + 2) - (-1/3) = y + 2 + 1/3 = y + 2 + 0.333... = y + 2.333...\\n\\nWait, maybe it's better to keep it as fractions. So, y + 2 + 1/3. To add these, I need a common denominator. Assuming y is a real number, I can keep it as it is for now.\\n\\nSo, left side: y + 2 + 1/3\\n\\nRight side: 4y - (y + 2) = 4y - y - 2 = 3y - 2\\n\\nSo, the equation is:\\n\\ny + 2 + 1/3 = 3y - 2\\n\\nNow, let's combine like terms. First, let's get all the y terms on one side and the constants on the other side.\\n\\nSubtract y from both sides:\\n\\n2 + 1/3 = 3y - y - 2\\n\\nWhich simplifies to:\\n\\n2 + 1/3 = 2y - 2\\n\\nNow, add 2 to both sides to get rid of the -2 on the right:\\n\\n2 + 2 + 1/3 = 2y\\n\\nSo, 4 + 1/3 = 2y\\n\\nThat's the same as 12/3 + 1/3 = 2y, which is 13/3 = 2y\\n\\nNow, divide both sides by 2 to solve for y:\\n\\n(13/3)/2 = y\\n\\nWhich is the same as 13/3 * 1/2 = y\\n\\nSo, y = 13/6\\n\\nWait, let me check that again. Starting from:\\n\\n4 + 1/3 = 2y\\n\\nThat's 12/3 + 1/3 = 13/3 = 2y\\n\\nThen, y = 13/6\\n\\nBut let me verify if this makes sense in the original sequence.\\n\\nLet's plug y = 13/6 back into the terms.\\n\\nFirst term: -1/3\\n\\nSecond term: y + 2 = 13/6 + 2 = 13/6 + 12/6 = 25/6\\n\\nThird term: 4y = 4*(13/6) = 52/6 = 26/3\\n\\nNow, check if the differences are equal.\\n\\nDifference between second and first term: 25/6 - (-1/3) = 25/6 + 1/3 = 25/6 + 2/6 = 27/6 = 9/2\\n\\nDifference between third and second term: 26/3 - 25/6 = 52/6 - 25/6 = 27/6 = 9/2\\n\\nYes, both differences are 9/2, so y = 13/6 is indeed the correct solution.\\n\\nAlternatively, I could check if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence.\\n\\nThe general formula for the nth term is a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\\n\\nGiven the first term a_1 = -1/3, the second term a_2 = y + 2, and the third term a_3 = 4y.\\n\\nUsing the formula:\\n\\na_2 = a_1 + d => y + 2 = -1/3 + d\\n\\na_3 = a_1 + 2d => 4y = -1/3 + 2d\\n\\nNow, from the first equation: d = y + 2 + 1/3 = y + 7/3\\n\\nPlugging this into the second equation:\\n\\n4y = -1/3 + 2(y + 7/3)\\n\\nLet's solve this:\\n\\n4y = -1/3 + 2y + 14/3\\n\\nSubtract 2y from both sides:\\n\\n2y = -1/3 + 14/3\\n\\n2y = 13/3\\n\\ny = 13/6\\n\\nSame answer as before. So, y = 13/6 is correct.\\n\\nMaybe I can consider if there's a more straightforward way to see this. Since it's an arithmetic sequence, the average of the first and third terms should equal the second term.\\n\\nSo, (a_1 + a_3)/2 = a_2\\n\\nPlugging in the values:\\n\\n(-1/3 + 4y)/2 = y + 2\\n\\nMultiply both sides by 2:\\n\\n-1/3 + 4y = 2y + 4\\n\\nSubtract 2y from both sides:\\n\\n-1/3 + 2y = 4\\n\\nAdd 1/3 to both sides:\\n\\n2y = 4 + 1/3 = 12/3 + 1/3 = 13/3\\n\\nDivide by 2:\\n\\ny = 13/6\\n\\nAgain, the same result. It seems no matter which approach I take, y = 13/6 is the solution.\\n\\nPerhaps I should consider if there could be multiple solutions or if the problem has any constraints that I'm missing. For example, are there any restrictions on y, like it has to be positive or integer-valued? The problem doesn't specify any such constraints, so y = 13/6 seems to be the only solution.\\n\\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if the sequence could have a common difference of zero, meaning all terms are equal. If that were the case, then:\\n\\n-1/3 = y + 2 = 4y\\n\\nFrom -1/3 = y + 2, we get y = -1/3 - 2 = -1/3 - 6/3 = -7/3\\n\\nBut then, 4y = 4*(-7/3) = -28/3, which is not equal to y + 2 = -7/3 + 6/3 = -1/3. So, the terms are not equal, hence the common difference is not zero. Therefore, y = 13/6 is indeed the correct solution.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the concept of common difference between consecutive terms.\\n\\nGiven that d = a_2 - a_1 = a_3 - a_2\\n\\nSo, (y + 2) - (-1/3) = 4y - (y + 2)\\n\\nSimplify:\\n\\ny + 2 + 1/3 = 4y - y - 2\\n\\ny + 2 + 1/3 = 3y - 2\\n\\nNow, subtract y from both sides:\\n\\n2 + 1/3 = 2y - 2\\n\\nAdd 2 to both sides:\\n\\n4 + 1/3 = 2y\\n\\nWhich is 13/3 = 2y\\n\\nThus, y = 13/6\\n\\nOnce again, the same answer. It seems undeniable now that y = 13/6 is the solution.\\n\\nMaybe I can think about it graphically. If I plot the terms of the sequence against their positions, in an arithmetic sequence, the points should lie on a straight line. The slope of that line is the common difference 'd'.\\n\\nBut that might be overcomplicating things for this problem.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the sequence in terms of y and set up equations based on the properties of arithmetic sequences.\\n\\nFor instance, since it's arithmetic, the following must hold for any three consecutive terms a, b, c:\\n\\n2b = a + c\\n\\nApplying this to our terms:\\n\\n2(y + 2) = -1/3 + 4y\\n\\nLet's solve this:\\n\\n2y + 4 = -1/3 + 4y\\n\\nSubtract 2y from both sides:\\n\\n4 = -1/3 + 2y\\n\\nAdd 1/3 to both sides:\\n\\n4 + 1/3 = 2y\\n\\nWhich is 12/3 + 1/3 = 13/3 = 2y\\n\\nTherefore, y = 13/6\\n\\nSame result yet again.\\n\\nI think it's clear now that y = 13/6 is the correct solution. Perhaps the reason there are multiple ways to approach this problem is that the properties of arithmetic sequences are interconnected, and each method is essentially exploiting these relationships.\\n\\nIt's good to see that no matter which method I use, I arrive at the same answer. This gives me confidence that my solution is correct.\\n\\nJust to summarize, the key to solving this problem was recognizing that in an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. By setting up an equation based on this property and solving for y, I was able to find the value of y that makes the given terms part of an arithmetic sequence.\\n\\nThis problem also reinforces the importance of being comfortable with algebraic manipulations, especially when dealing with fractions, as precision is crucial in maintaining the integrity of the equation.\\n\\nIn conclusion, y = 13/6 is the solution to the problem.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\boxed{\\\\dfrac{13}{6}} \\\\]\"},\n",

       "  'output': \"So I have this problem here: suppose that \\\\( g(x) = 5x - 3 \\\\). I need to find \\\\( g^{-1}(g^{-1}(14)) \\\\). Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand what \\\\( g^{-1} \\\\) is. \\\\( g^{-1} \\\\) is the inverse function of \\\\( g \\\\). So, if \\\\( g \\\\) takes \\\\( x \\\\) and gives me \\\\( 5x - 3 \\\\), then \\\\( g^{-1} \\\\) should take a value and give me back the original \\\\( x \\\\) that was plugged into \\\\( g \\\\) to get that value.\\n\\nTo find \\\\( g^{-1} \\\\), I need to solve for \\\\( x \\\\) in terms of \\\\( y \\\\), where \\\\( y = g(x) \\\\). So, starting with:\\n\\n\\\\[ y = 5x - 3 \\\\]\\n\\nI'll solve for \\\\( x \\\\):\\n\\n\\\\[ y + 3 = 5x \\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[ x = \\\\frac{y + 3}{5} \\\\]\\n\\nTherefore, the inverse function \\\\( g^{-1}(y) = \\\\frac{y + 3}{5} \\\\).\\n\\nNow, the problem asks for \\\\( g^{-1}(g^{-1}(14)) \\\\). So, I need to apply \\\\( g^{-1} \\\\) twice to the number 14.\\n\\nFirst, let's find \\\\( g^{-1}(14) \\\\):\\n\\n\\\\[ g^{-1}(14) = \\\\frac{14 + 3}{5} = \\\\frac{17}{5} = 3.4 \\\\]\\n\\nNext, I need to find \\\\( g^{-1}(3.4) \\\\):\\n\\n\\\\[ g^{-1}(3.4) = \\\\frac{3.4 + 3}{5} = \\\\frac{6.4}{5} = 1.28 \\\\]\\n\\nSo, \\\\( g^{-1}(g^{-1}(14)) = 1.28 \\\\).\\n\\nWait a minute, let's double-check that. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this without plugging in numbers twice.\\n\\nLet's consider that \\\\( g^{-1}(g^{-1}(14)) \\\\) is like applying the inverse function twice. Maybe I can find a general expression for \\\\( g^{-1}(g^{-1}(x)) \\\\).\\n\\nGiven that \\\\( g^{-1}(x) = \\\\frac{x + 3}{5} \\\\), then:\\n\\n\\\\[ g^{-1}(g^{-1}(x)) = g^{-1}\\\\left( \\\\frac{x + 3}{5} \\\\right) \\\\]\\n\\nNow, plug \\\\( \\\\frac{x + 3}{5} \\\\) into \\\\( g^{-1} \\\\):\\n\\n\\\\[ g^{-1}\\\\left( \\\\frac{x + 3}{5} \\\\right) = \\\\frac{\\\\left( \\\\frac{x + 3}{5} \\\\right) + 3}{5} = \\\\frac{\\\\frac{x + 3 + 15}{5}}{5} = \\\\frac{\\\\frac{x + 18}{5}}{5} = \\\\frac{x + 18}{25} \\\\]\\n\\nSo, \\\\( g^{-1}(g^{-1}(x)) = \\\\frac{x + 18}{25} \\\\).\\n\\nNow, plugging in \\\\( x = 14 \\\\):\\n\\n\\\\[ g^{-1}(g^{-1}(14)) = \\\\frac{14 + 18}{25} = \\\\frac{32}{25} = 1.28 \\\\]\\n\\nThat matches what I got earlier by plugging in the numbers step by step. So, it looks like 1.28 is the correct answer.\\n\\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can check this another way. Let's think about what \\\\( g^{-1}(g^{-1}(14)) \\\\) means in terms of the function \\\\( g \\\\).\\n\\nLet’s denote \\\\( g^{-1}(14) = a \\\\), so \\\\( g(a) = 14 \\\\). Then, \\\\( g^{-1}(a) = g^{-1}(g^{-1}(14)) \\\\), which is what we're trying to find.\\n\\nBut I already found that \\\\( a = 3.4 \\\\), and then \\\\( g^{-1}(3.4) = 1.28 \\\\), which is consistent with what I did before.\\n\\nAlternatively, since \\\\( g(g^{-1}(x)) = x \\\\), but in this case, I'm dealing with \\\\( g^{-1}(g^{-1}(x)) \\\\), which isn't directly simplifiable using that property.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of composing functions. The composition of inverse functions would cancel out, but since I'm applying the inverse twice, it's not immediately obvious.\\n\\nWait, actually, if I consider that \\\\( g^{-1}(g^{-1}(x)) = g^{-1} \\\\circ g^{-1}(x) \\\\), and I've already derived that \\\\( g^{-1} \\\\circ g^{-1}(x) = \\\\frac{x + 18}{25} \\\\), which is what I used to get 1.28, that seems solid.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the function \\\\( g \\\\) and its inverse in terms of their effects on \\\\( x \\\\).\\n\\nThe function \\\\( g(x) = 5x - 3 \\\\) stretches \\\\( x \\\\) by a factor of 5 and then shifts it down by 3. The inverse function \\\\( g^{-1}(x) = \\\\frac{x + 3}{5} \\\\) shifts \\\\( x \\\\) up by 3 and then compresses it by a factor of 5.\\n\\nApplying \\\\( g^{-1} \\\\) once to 14 shifts it up by 3 to 17 and then divides by 5 to get 3.4. Applying \\\\( g^{-1} \\\\) again shifts 3.4 up by 3 to 6.4 and then divides by 5 to get 1.28. That makes sense.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about this in terms of solving for a value.\\n\\nLet’s say \\\\( y = g^{-1}(g^{-1}(14)) \\\\). Then, \\\\( g(y) = g^{-1}(14) \\\\), because applying \\\\( g \\\\) to both sides gives:\\n\\n\\\\[ g(y) = g^{-1}(14) \\\\]\\n\\nBut \\\\( g^{-1}(14) = 3.4 \\\\), as I found earlier. So, \\\\( g(y) = 3.4 \\\\).\\n\\nNow, \\\\( g(y) = 5y - 3 = 3.4 \\\\). Solving for \\\\( y \\\\):\\n\\n\\\\[ 5y - 3 = 3.4 \\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[ 5y = 6.4 \\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[ y = 1.28 \\\\]\\n\\nAgain, this confirms the earlier result.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the general expression for \\\\( g^{-1}(g^{-1}(x)) \\\\) and see if there's another way to derive it.\\n\\nStarting with \\\\( g^{-1}(x) = \\\\frac{x + 3}{5} \\\\), then:\\n\\n\\\\[ g^{-1}(g^{-1}(x)) = g^{-1}\\\\left( \\\\frac{x + 3}{5} \\\\right) = \\\\frac{\\\\frac{x + 3}{5} + 3}{5} = \\\\frac{\\\\frac{x + 3 + 15}{5}}{5} = \\\\frac{x + 18}{25} \\\\]\\n\\nWhich is what I had before.\\n\\nSo, no matter which way I approach it, I keep arriving at the same expression and the same numerical answer.\\n\\nPerhaps I can also consider the graphical interpretation. The inverse function \\\\( g^{-1} \\\\) reflects \\\\( g \\\\) over the line \\\\( y = x \\\\). Applying \\\\( g^{-1} \\\\) twice would be like reflecting twice over \\\\( y = x \\\\), which might have some geometric significance, but I'm not sure if that helps me here.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the functions in terms of their graphs. The graph of \\\\( g(x) = 5x - 3 \\\\) is a straight line with slope 5 and y-intercept -3. The inverse function \\\\( g^{-1}(x) = \\\\frac{x + 3}{5} \\\\) is also a straight line with slope 1/5 and y-intercept 3/5.\\n\\nApplying \\\\( g^{-1} \\\\) twice would be like applying two linear transformations in sequence. The overall transformation would be another linear transformation with slope \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{5} \\\\times \\\\frac{1}{5} = \\\\frac{1}{25} \\\\), which matches the derivative of \\\\( \\\\frac{x + 18}{25} \\\\), since the derivative is \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{25} \\\\).\\n\\nAlso, the y-intercept of \\\\( g^{-1}(x) \\\\) is 3/5, and applying it again would involve plugging in the previous output.\\n\\nWait, maybe I can think of it in terms of function composition.\\n\\nGiven \\\\( g^{-1}(x) = \\\\frac{x + 3}{5} \\\\), then:\\n\\n\\\\[ g^{-1} \\\\circ g^{-1}(x) = g^{-1}\\\\left( \\\\frac{x + 3}{5} \\\\right) = \\\\frac{\\\\frac{x + 3}{5} + 3}{5} = \\\\frac{x + 3 + 15}{25} = \\\\frac{x + 18}{25} \\\\]\\n\\nAgain, confirming the earlier result.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the general property of inverse functions and their iterated applications, but I think that might be overcomplicating things for this problem.\\n\\nGiven all these consistent results, I'm confident that the answer is indeed 1.28.\\n\\nJust to be absolutely sure, let's plug in the numbers again.\\n\\nFirst, \\\\( g^{-1}(14) = \\\\frac{14 + 3}{5} = \\\\frac{17}{5} = 3.4 \\\\)\\n\\nThen, \\\\( g^{-1}(3.4) = \\\\frac{3.4 + 3}{5} = \\\\frac{6.4}{5} = 1.28 \\\\)\\n\\nYes, that's consistent.\\n\\nAlternatively, using the combined formula:\\n\\n\\\\( g^{-1}(g^{-1}(14)) = \\\\frac{14 + 18}{25} = \\\\frac{32}{25} = 1.28 \\\\)\\n\\nSame answer.\\n\\nI think it's safe to conclude that the final answer is 1.28.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\boxed{1.28} \\\\]\"}]"

So, the terms are not equal, hence the common difference is not zero. Therefore, y = 13/6 is indeed the correct solution.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the concept of common difference between consecutive terms.\\n\\nGiven that d = a_2 - a_1 = a_3 - a_2\\n\\nSo, (y + 2) - (-1/3) = 4y - (y + 2)\\n\\nSimplify:\\n\\ny + 2 + 1/3 = 4y - y - 2\\n\\ny + 2 + 1/3 = 3y - 2\\n\\nNow, subtract y from both sides:\\n\\n2 + 1/3 = 2y - 2\\n\\nAdd 2 to both sides:\\n\\n4 + 1/3 = 2y\\n\\nWhich is 13/3 = 2y\\n\\nThus, y = 13/6\\n\\nOnce again, the same answer. It seems undeniable now that y = 13/6 is the solution.\\n\\nMaybe I can think about it graphically. If I plot the terms of the sequence against their positions, in an arithmetic sequence, the points should lie on a straight line. The slope of that line is the common difference 'd'.\\n\\nBut that might be overcomplicating things for this problem.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the sequence in terms of y and set up equations based on the properties of arithmetic sequences.\\n\\nFor instance, since it's arithmetic, the following must hold for any three consecutive terms a, b, c:\\n\\n2b = a + c\\n\\nApplying this to our terms:\\n\\n2(y + 2) = -1/3 + 4y\\n\\nLet's solve this:\\n\\n2y + 4 = -1/3 + 4y\\n\\nSubtract 2y from both sides:\\n\\n4 = -1/3 + 2y\\n\\nAdd 1/3 to both sides:\\n\\n4 + 1/3 = 2y\\n\\nWhich is 12/3 + 1/3 = 13/3 = 2y\\n\\nTherefore, y = 13/6\\n\\nSame result yet again.\\n\\nI think it's clear now that y = 13/6 is the correct solution. Perhaps the reason there are multiple ways to approach this problem is that the properties of arithmetic sequences are interconnected, and each method is essentially exploiting these relationships.\\n\\nIt's good to see that no matter which method I use, I arrive at the same answer. This gives me confidence that my solution is correct.\\n\\nJust to summarize, the key to solving this problem was recognizing that in an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. By setting up an equation based on this property and solving for y, I was able to find the value of y that makes the given terms part of an arithmetic sequence.\\n\\nThis problem also reinforces the importance of being comfortable with algebraic manipulations, especially when dealing with fractions, as precision is crucial in maintaining the integrity of the equation.\\n\\nIn conclusion, y = 13/6 is the solution to the problem.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\boxed{\\\\dfrac{13}{6}} \\\\]\",\n",

       "  {'content': \"So I have this problem here: suppose that \\\\( g(x) = 5x - 3 \\\\). I need to find \\\\( g^{-1}(g^{-1}(14)) \\\\). Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand what \\\\( g^{-1} \\\\) is. \\\\( g^{-1} \\\\) is the inverse function of \\\\( g \\\\). So, if \\\\( g \\\\) takes \\\\( x \\\\) and gives me \\\\( 5x - 3 \\\\), then \\\\( g^{-1} \\\\) should take a value and give me back the original \\\\( x \\\\) that was plugged into \\\\( g \\\\) to get that value.\\n\\nTo find \\\\( g^{-1} \\\\), I need to solve for \\\\( x \\\\) in terms of \\\\( y \\\\), where \\\\( y = g(x) \\\\). So, starting with:\\n\\n\\\\[ y = 5x - 3 \\\\]\\n\\nI'll solve for \\\\( x \\\\):\\n\\n\\\\[ y + 3 = 5x \\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[ x = \\\\frac{y + 3}{5} \\\\]\\n\\nTherefore, the inverse function \\\\( g^{-1}(y) = \\\\frac{y + 3}{5} \\\\).\\n\\nNow, the problem asks for \\\\( g^{-1}(g^{-1}(14)) \\\\). So, I need to apply \\\\( g^{-1} \\\\) twice to the number 14.\\n\\nFirst, let's find \\\\( g^{-1}(14) \\\\):\\n\\n\\\\[ g^{-1}(14) = \\\\frac{14 + 3}{5} = \\\\frac{17}{5} = 3.4 \\\\]\\n\\nNext, I need to find \\\\( g^{-1}(3.4) \\\\):\\n\\n\\\\[ g^{-1}(3.4) = \\\\frac{3.4 + 3}{5} = \\\\frac{6.4}{5} = 1.28 \\\\]\\n\\nSo, \\\\( g^{-1}(g^{-1}(14)) = 1.28 \\\\).\\n\\nWait a minute, let's double-check that. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this without plugging in numbers twice.\\n\\nLet's consider that \\\\( g^{-1}(g^{-1}(14)) \\\\) is like applying the inverse function twice. Maybe I can find a general expression for \\\\( g^{-1}(g^{-1}(x)) \\\\).\\n\\nGiven that \\\\( g^{-1}(x) = \\\\frac{x + 3}{5} \\\\), then:\\n\\n\\\\[ g^{-1}(g^{-1}(x)) = g^{-1}\\\\left( \\\\frac{x + 3}{5} \\\\right) \\\\]\\n\\nNow, plug \\\\( \\\\frac{x + 3}{5} \\\\) into \\\\( g^{-1} \\\\):\\n\\n\\\\[ g^{-1}\\\\left( \\\\frac{x + 3}{5} \\\\right) = \\\\frac{\\\\left( \\\\frac{x + 3}{5} \\\\right) + 3}{5} = \\\\frac{\\\\frac{x + 3 + 15}{5}}{5} = \\\\frac{\\\\frac{x + 18}{5}}{5} = \\\\frac{x + 18}{25} \\\\]\\n\\nSo, \\\\( g^{-1}(g^{-1}(x)) = \\\\frac{x + 18}{25} \\\\).\\n\\nNow, plugging in \\\\( x = 14 \\\\):\\n\\n\\\\[ g^{-1}(g^{-1}(14)) = \\\\frac{14 + 18}{25} = \\\\frac{32}{25} = 1.28 \\\\]\\n\\nThat matches what I got earlier by plugging in the numbers step by step. So, it looks like 1.28 is the correct answer.\\n\\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can check this another way. Let's think about what \\\\( g^{-1}(g^{-1}(14)) \\\\) means in terms of the function \\\\( g \\\\).\\n\\nLet’s denote \\\\( g^{-1}(14) = a \\\\), so \\\\( g(a) = 14 \\\\). Then, \\\\( g^{-1}(a) = g^{-1}(g^{-1}(14)) \\\\), which is what we're trying to find.\\n\\nBut I already found that \\\\( a = 3.4 \\\\), and then \\\\( g^{-1}(3.4) = 1.28 \\\\), which is consistent with what I did before.\\n\\nAlternatively, since \\\\( g(g^{-1}(x)) = x \\\\), but in this case, I'm dealing with \\\\( g^{-1}(g^{-1}(x)) \\\\), which isn't directly simplifiable using that property.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of composing functions. The composition of inverse functions would cancel out, but since I'm applying the inverse twice, it's not immediately obvious.\\n\\nWait, actually, if I consider that \\\\( g^{-1}(g^{-1}(x)) = g^{-1} \\\\circ g^{-1}(x) \\\\), and I've already derived that \\\\( g^{-1} \\\\circ g^{-1}(x) = \\\\frac{x + 18}{25} \\\\), which is what I used to get 1.28, that seems solid.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the function \\\\( g \\\\) and its inverse in terms of their effects on \\\\( x \\\\).\\n\\nThe function \\\\( g(x) = 5x - 3 \\\\) stretches \\\\( x \\\\) by a factor of 5 and then shifts it down by 3. The inverse function \\\\( g^{-1}(x) = \\\\frac{x + 3}{5} \\\\) shifts \\\\( x \\\\) up by 3 and then compresses it by a factor of 5.\\n\\nApplying \\\\( g^{-1} \\\\) once to 14 shifts it up by 3 to 17 and then divides by 5 to get 3.4. Applying \\\\( g^{-1} \\\\) again shifts 3.4 up by 3 to 6.4 and then divides by 5 to get 1.28. That makes sense.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about this in terms of solving for a value.\\n\\nLet’s say \\\\( y = g^{-1}(g^{-1}(14)) \\\\). Then, \\\\( g(y) = g^{-1}(14) \\\\), because applying \\\\( g \\\\) to both sides gives:\\n\\n\\\\[ g(y) = g^{-1}(14) \\\\]\\n\\nBut \\\\( g^{-1}(14) = 3.4 \\\\), as I found earlier. So, \\\\( g(y) = 3.4 \\\\).\\n\\nNow, \\\\( g(y) = 5y - 3 = 3.4 \\\\). Solving for \\\\( y \\\\):\\n\\n\\\\[ 5y - 3 = 3.4 \\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[ 5y = 6.4 \\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[ y = 1.28 \\\\]\\n\\nAgain, this confirms the earlier result.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the general expression for \\\\( g^{-1}(g^{-1}(x)) \\\\) and see if there's another way to derive it.\\n\\nStarting with \\\\( g^{-1}(x) = \\\\frac{x + 3}{5} \\\\), then:\\n\\n\\\\[ g^{-1}(g^{-1}(x)) = g^{-1}\\\\left( \\\\frac{x + 3}{5} \\\\right) = \\\\frac{\\\\frac{x + 3}{5} + 3}{5} = \\\\frac{\\\\frac{x + 3 + 15}{5}}{5} = \\\\frac{x + 18}{25} \\\\]\\n\\nWhich is what I had before.\\n\\nSo, no matter which way I approach it, I keep arriving at the same expression and the same numerical answer.\\n\\nPerhaps I can also consider the graphical interpretation. The inverse function \\\\( g^{-1} \\\\) reflects \\\\( g \\\\) over the line \\\\( y = x \\\\). Applying \\\\( g^{-1} \\\\) twice would be like reflecting twice over \\\\( y = x \\\\), which might have some geometric significance, but I'm not sure if that helps me here.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the functions in terms of their graphs. The graph of \\\\( g(x) = 5x - 3 \\\\) is a straight line with slope 5 and y-intercept -3. The inverse function \\\\( g^{-1}(x) = \\\\frac{x + 3}{5} \\\\) is also a straight line with slope 1/5 and y-intercept 3/5.\\n\\nApplying \\\\( g^{-1} \\\\) twice would be like applying two linear transformations in sequence. The overall transformation would be another linear transformation with slope \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{5} \\\\times \\\\frac{1}{5} = \\\\frac{1}{25} \\\\), which matches the derivative of \\\\( \\\\frac{x + 18}{25} \\\\), since the derivative is \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{25} \\\\).\\n\\nAlso, the y-intercept of \\\\( g^{-1}(x) \\\\) is 3/5, and applying it again would involve plugging in the previous output.\\n\\nWait, maybe I can think of it in terms of function composition.\\n\\nGiven \\\\( g^{-1}(x) = \\\\frac{x + 3}{5} \\\\), then:\\n\\n\\\\[ g^{-1} \\\\circ g^{-1}(x) = g^{-1}\\\\left( \\\\frac{x + 3}{5} \\\\right) = \\\\frac{\\\\frac{x + 3}{5} + 3}{5} = \\\\frac{x + 3 + 15}{25} = \\\\frac{x + 18}{25} \\\\]\\n\\nAgain, confirming the earlier result.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the general property of inverse functions and their iterated applications, but I think that might be overcomplicating things for this problem.\\n\\nGiven all these consistent results, I'm confident that the answer is indeed 1.28.\\n\\nJust to be absolutely sure, let's plug in the numbers again.\\n\\nFirst, \\\\( g^{-1}(14) = \\\\frac{14 + 3}{5} = \\\\frac{17}{5} = 3.4 \\\\)\\n\\nThen, \\\\( g^{-1}(3.4) = \\\\frac{3.4 + 3}{5} = \\\\frac{6.4}{5} = 1.28 \\\\)\\n\\nYes, that's consistent.\\n\\nAlternatively, using the combined formula:\\n\\n\\\\( g^{-1}(g^{-1}(14)) = \\\\frac{14 + 18}{25} = \\\\frac{32}{25} = 1.28 \\\\)\\n\\nSame answer.\\n\\nI think it's safe to conclude that the final answer is 1.28.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\boxed{1.28} \\\\]\",\n",
